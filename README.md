TGEN texture generator
=========================

This is a node-based texture generator made in Godot Engine 3.2. It uses a hybrid approach allowing to mix shader instructions with post-processing image effects within the same graph.
The intented use is not only to generate procedural textures or terrains, but also the ability to save a generator to be re-used in a game, or embed the editor within other tools having the same needs.

This project is under development, many features aren't available yet.
